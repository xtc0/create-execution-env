This custom Execution Environment (EE) is designed for automating Microsoft Azure using **Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)**.

## Purpose of `ee-azure` folder:

ee-azure folder holds the "ingredients" for creating a new execution environment (from the minimal base container image).

The new execution environment created includes:
- `azure.azcollection` (Ansible Azure collection)
- Required Python packages: `six`, `psutil`
- Custom system packages can be defined in `bindep.txt` (which is currently empty)
- Built from the base image:  
  `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/ee-minimal-rhel9:latest`

## Contents of `ee-azure` folder:

```text
ee-azure/
├── execution-environment.yml    # EE build specification
├── requirements.yml             # Ansible collections
├── bindep.txt                   # System-level dependencies
├── requirements.txt (optional) # Python packages (auto-handled)
└── context/                     # Auto-generated by ansible-builder
```
## Requirements to create `context` folder within `ee-azure` folder:

To create this 'context' folder and its contents (in order to create a new execution environment), create execution-environment.yml and requirements.yml. Then use the command 'ansible-builder create'.

- For examples of execution-environment.yml and requirements.yml files, please refer to those files in this repo.
