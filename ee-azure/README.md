This custom Execution Environment (EE) is designed for automating Microsoft Azure using **Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)**.

ee-azure folder holds the "ingredients" for creating a new execution environment (from the minimal base container image).

The new execution environment created includes:
- `azure.azcollection` (Ansible Azure collection)
- Required Python packages: `six`, `psutil`
- Custom system packages can be defined in `bindep.txt` (which is currently empty)
- Built from the base image:  
  `registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/ee-minimal-rhel9:latest`

<pre> ## 📁 Overview of `ee-azure` folder: ```text ee-azure/ ├── execution-environment.yml # EE build specification ├── requirements.yml # Ansible collections ├── bindep.txt # System-level dependencies ├── requirements.txt (optional) # Python packages (auto-handled) └── context/ # Auto-generated by ansible-builder ``` </pre>

To create this 'context' folder and some of its contents (in order to create a new execution environment), create execution-environment.yml and requirements.yml. Then use the command 'ansible-builder create'.
